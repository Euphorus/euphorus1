I am a programmer with strong focus on C for realibility and simplicity. I dabble on other languages as well like C++, Python and C#. I love breaking stuff, whether it is in video games or code. The more I break it, the more I understand what is going wrong with it. 
For my development I've switched from Windows to Linux (Fedora 42) with Neovim. I'm still learning about the potentials to maximize my usage in Linux.
